If interest rates increase after you purchase a Treasury security, the market value of the security may decrease.

            "3. Reinvestment risk: If you hold a Treasury security that pays interest periodically and interest rates have declined when that security matures, you may have to reinvest the principal at a lower rate. This can reduce the overall return on your investment.\n",

            "4. Credit risk: While U.S. Treasury securities are considered among the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, there is still a small risk that the government may default on its obligations. This risk is generally considered very low compared to other investments.\n",
